			<b> Abstract: </b>
		</p>
		<p>
			Path tracing is an unbiased Monte Carlo rendering technique that can be used to create physically realistic images. Path tracing is one algorithm that solves Kajiya’s “rendering equation” (1986), which describes radiance emitted towards a view direction from a particular point, given functions for incoming light and bidirectional scattering. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I have proposed this study of path tracing as a two semester project.  This semester, I have read about path tracing theory and the Monte Carlo methods that the algorithm is built upon.  In my final report, I give an overview of the rendering equation and Monte Carlo methods for evaluating the equation. First, Kajiya’s rendering equation is introduced, and the manner in which it represents light transport is explained.  Next, a brief background and examples of stochastic rendering processes are given.  Much of the report is focused on building up a foundation for understanding Monte Carlo methods.  Extensive discussion is focused on how Monte Carlo numerical integration works, various methods for generating samples, and how Kajiya’s equation can be rewritten to provide an intuitive understanding of how the path tracing algorithm came about. Sampling techniques discussed are uniform random sampling, importance sampling, and multiple importance sampling.  Different forms of Kajiya’s equation that are discussed include the surface form and the path integral form.  Unidirectional path tracing is discussed, and the stochastic processes used in generating paths is described.

			In addition to summarizing the theory I have read about this term, my project involved building a simple unidirectional path tracer.  With this path tracer, I have produced images that show lighting contributions from direct lighting, indirect lighting without Russian roulette, and indirect lighting with Russian roulette.  At the end of the report, I discuss limitations of the current implementation, and areas I would like to extend.  
		</p>
		<p>
			Next term, I would like to build upon this project and extend my current path tracer to make use of more of the sampling methods described, as well as implement a variety of material models.
